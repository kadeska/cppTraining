# cppTraining
This project will be where I learn C++ and Vulken. I am working on a Codecademy course for C++ and folling along with a tutorial on Vulken, and making a custom game engine to create something in the future. 

# Want to join me or contribute to this project? 
My setup is built on a Ubuntu Linux computer. I used [these instructions](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux) to set up my workspace. Please note that you need to have a compiler that supports C++17. You'll also need cmake for this to work.

#### These are the packages you will need to istall to be able to compile and run this project. All of witch can be done through thr above mentioned instructions for Linux. 
1) Vulkan Packages
2) GLFW
3) GLM
4) Shader Compiler

If you dont daily drive Linux like me, dont panic! The above mentioned instructions also have Windows and Mac instructions just for you! Yay! After installing the above listed packages you *should* be good-to-go for compilling and running this project on your own system. If you find that it doesnt work for whatever reason, please refer yourself back to the above mentioned [instructions](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) and follow the proper development evironment set up for your computer. You shouldn't run accros any issues. If you do than please post an issue thread and someone will do their best to help you.
